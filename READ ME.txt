How to Run Your Django Web Application
Activate the Virtual Environment

Before starting, ensure you activate the virtual environment you created for the project. The name of the environment is imsenv.
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the imsenv environment.
Activate the environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
imsenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source imsenv/bin/activate
Run the Server

Once the virtual environment is activated, navigate to the folder containing your Django project (where manage.py is located), which would be in cd .\inventoryproject\.
Run the following command in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the Application

After running the command, a URL will be displayed in the terminal, such as:
bash
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Hold the Ctrl key and click on the URL (or copy-paste it into your browser). This will open the application in your default browser.
Logging In

Admin User:
Username: Admin
Password: imsadmin
The admin user has full rights to view and manage all areas of the application.
Staff User:
Username: Hasan
Password: Hasan123456
The staff user has restricted permissions based on your application's settings.
Stop the Server

To stop the server, return to the terminal running the application and press Ctrl + C.
